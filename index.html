  <p>The main essence of this tutorial is to:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>Show you how to format a web document with HTML</li>
       <li>Show you how to design a web page with CSS</li>
       <li>Show you how to program a web document with JavaScript</li>
    </ul>

  <p>Now, let's do some math:</p>
  <p>First number: <span class="number" id="firstNum">173</span> <br></p>
  <p>Second number: <span class="number" id="secondNum">40</span> </p>
  <p>The sum of the two numbers is: <span class="number" id="sumanswer">(Placeholder)</span></p>
  <input type="button" id="sumButton" value="Add them up!">

  <p>The difference of the two numbers is: <span class="number" id="diffanswer">(Placeholder)</span></p>
  <input type="button" id="diffButton" value="Subtract them!">

  <p>The product of the two numbers is: <span class="number" id="prodanswer">(Placeholder)</span></p>
  <input type="button" id="prodButton" value="Multiply them!">

  <p>The quotient of the two numbers is: <span class="number" id="quoanswer">(Placeholder)</span></p>
  <input type="button" id="quoButton" value="Divide them!">
